* **Contexts**: Free-form narrative or lore storage.

### Quest System

* **Main Quests**: Structured, multi-objective storylines that drive campaign progression.
* **Side Quests**: Optional, player-driven tasks that integrate dynamically with the main narrative.

### Timeline System

* Hierarchical progression of events:
  **Era → Chapter → Encounter → Action → Check**.
* Player actions require DM (human or AI) approval and may trigger skill checks.
* Checks can be resolved via **dice rolls** or **interactive minigames**.
* Designed for **traceability and replayability**, presented in a **chat-style UI**.

## Getting Started

This project is currently in **early development**.  
Installation and usage instructions will be added as the system becomes more stable.  
At this stage, the repository is primarily focused on **system design, architecture, and prototyping** rather than end-user deployment.
